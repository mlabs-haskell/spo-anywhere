# SPO-Anywhere on Hetzner Cloud

This Nix flake template installs a Stake Pool on Hetzner cloud using `spo-anywhere`.

## Prerequisites

To get started create an Hetzner cloud machine (tested with Ubuntu) and make sure you are able to connect as `root` with ssh.

You also need to generate a set of stake pool keys, you can follow our documentation section on [generating keys](https://mlabs-haskell.github.io/spo-anywhere/usage/generate-keys/).
