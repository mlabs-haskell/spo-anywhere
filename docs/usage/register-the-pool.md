A running node doesn't start mining blocks until it is registered as a pool. One also needs a registered stake address to collect the gains.

In practice this means a need to submit two registering transactions as described in [cardano developer docs](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/block-producer-keys). This can be done already after the pool is running.
